 * Marks an interface for processing by AIDL2 annotation processor. Putting this annotation on

 *
 * The annotation processor will generate an implementation of parameter-marshalling code, using
 * {@link Binder} and {@link Parcel} Android classes. Those implementations can be successively
 * accessed via {@link InterfaceLoader}.
 *
 * The processor generates implementation code for every abstract abstrMethod, present in interface,
 * including methods, inherited from parent interfaces. Default methods and methods, inherited from
 * {@link Object}, are ignored â€” you can force them to be included by directly declaring them in
 * interface code.
