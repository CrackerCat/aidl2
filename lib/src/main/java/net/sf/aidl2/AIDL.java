 * accessed via {@link InterfaceLoader}.
 *
 * The processor generates implementation code for every abstract method, present in interface,
 * including methods, inherited from parent interfaces. Default methods and methods, inherited from
 * {@link Object}, are ignored â€” you can force them to be included by directly declaring them in
